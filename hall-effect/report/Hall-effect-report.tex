The Hall Effect is a phenomena of solid materials that has been in use since 
the turn of the century. In this experiment we used the AC and DC hall effect 
to see the properties of a Si doped semiconductor sample including: the type 
of semiconductor, carrier mobility and density and the resistivity of the 
sample. It was determined the sample was an n-type emiconductor, with a 
temperature dependent carrier density with values: 3.08$x10^{20}$ 
$\pm$ 0.09$x10^{20}$ at 80K, 3.1$x10^{20}$ $\pm$ 0.3$x10^{20}$ at 100K,

0.04$x10^{20}$ at 140K, 2.8$x10^{20}$ $\pm$ 0.1$x10^{20}$ at 160K, 
3.5$x10^{20}$ $\pm$ 0.1$x10^{20}$ at 180K, 3.12$x10^{20}$ $\pm$ 0.07$x10^{20}$

temperature dependent values of: 1.44$x10^{-2}$              
$\pm$ 0.05$x10^{-2}$ at 80K, 1.5$x10^{-2}$ $\pm$ 0.1$x10^{-2}$ at 100K,

\section{Introduction}
The hall Effect was discovered by Edwin H. Hall in 1879, who at the time was 
studying Rowland at Johns Hopkins University. During those days no one knew of 
the electron and by extension how it was that conduction actually happened. 
Due to this it took almost 50 years until the Hall Effect was fully understood 
with the formulation of quantum mechanics. The results that were gotten from 
the experiment were generally not very well understood \cite{ref:1}.
\\
However, when quantum mechanics was formulated and the Hall Effect became fully 
understood it began to be employed in the study of semiconductors. It was here 
that it fullfilled its promise in the study of the concentration and sign of 
charge carriers \cite{ref:1}. Both of which are to be found in this experiment. 
\\
There are four different types of materials: insulators and superconductors, 
semiconductors and conductors. The difference between all of these are the 
resistivity and conductivity values for them. Insulators and superconductors 
behave in a very similar fashion in that they allow almost no current to pass 
through them, they have near infinite resistivities and near zero conductivity 
values. Conductors are the polar opposite of them having very low resistivity 
values and extremely high conductivity. Semiconductors are the middle ground 
where the two meet having finite resistivity and conductivity values.
\\
Semiconductors are an integral 
part in our daily lives since they have been in wide use in electronics such 
as: computers, cell phones and LED bulbs. The Hall Effect has given a far 
reaching insight into how and why it is that the properties listed above 
display such distinct behaviors.
\\
For the experiment a large electromagnet with a magnetic field range of 0 T to 
0.6678 T was used to create a homogenous strong magnetic field. To receive the 
signals a lock-in amplifier was used for the AC Hall Voltage measurements and a 
simple multi-meter was used to measure the DC Hall Voltage measurements. The 
temperature of the sample could also be controlled via a PID temperature 
controller that allowed to heat up the sample and it was cooled down through 
the use of Liquid Nitrogen (LN). The sample was housed in a cryostat chamber 
containing a very dilute Helium gas concentration to be a thermal contact 
between the inner chamber and the LN.
\\
The sample was a Silicon doped semiconductor which we put at cryogenic 
temperatures and in a high intensity magnetic field to perform the measurements.

From electricity and magnetism we know that charged particles passing through 
a magnetic field display the following force relation,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:1}
\vec{F}=q(\vec{E}+\vec{v}\times\vec{B})
\end{equation}
Where, q is the charge of the particle, $\vec{E}$ is the electric field 
in the space of the particle, $\vec{v}$ is its velocity and $\vec{B}$ is the 
magnetic field. Usually, we can consider the contribution of the electric field 
to the force to be zero so we can write equation \ref{eqn:1} as,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:2}
\vec{F}=q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}
\end{equation}
So that is to say that the charge carriers will receive a force that is 
perpendicular to their motion and as a cause will begin to curve. If we now 
think about a solid material through which we pass some current it would look 
like figure \ref{fig:1}b. Where the electrons are free to move through the 
entire sample and have nothing directing their movement other than the electric 
current that is passing through the sample. For a pictorial representation of 
what happend when we apply a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the sample 
refer to figures \ref{fig:1}c,d. This makes sense with equation \ref{eqn:2} and 
what we generally know of charged particles passing through a perpendicular 
magnetic field. Looking at figure \ref{fig:1}d the reason why it does in fact 
produce an electric field inside of the sample is due to the electrons that 
have curved to a side of the sample and since they can't conduct very easily 
through the a air they accumulate at the boundary of the sample toward which 
they curve creating a gradient of electrons and lack of electrons (positive 
charge) which gives rise to a potential difference through the sample and 
therefore an electric field through the sample.
\\
This perpendicular magnetic field can be calculated with equation \ref{eqn:3}.
\begin{equation}
\vec{E}_t = \frac{-\vec{J}\times\vec{B}}{nq}
\cite{ref:1}
\label{eqn:3}
\end{equation}
Where, $\vec{J}$ is the current density, $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field 
passing through the sample,n is the number carriers and q is the charge of the 
carriers.
\\
Equation \ref{eqn:3} is mainly useful were qe to know all of the 
parameters we need which, for this experiment, we need to find. So we take a 
different approach in our equation derivations starting with how to calculate 
the resistivity of a semiconductor sample.
\\
When we have a sample with a current passing through it of certain current 
density, j, We can show that the electric field is related in the following way,
\begin{equation}
\vec{E} = \rho\vec{j}
\cite{ref:3}
\label{eqn:4}
\end{equation}
Where, $\rho$ is the resistivity of the sample. By multiplying both sides of 
equation \ref{eqn:3} by the length of the sample, l, we can get a relation 
between the voltage and the resistivity.
\begin{equation}
V = \rho\frac{l}{tw} I 
\cite{ref:3}
\label{eqn:5}
\end{equation}
Where, l,t,w are the dimensions shown of figure \ref{fig:2}b and I is the 
total current through the sample. By then applying Ohm's law, V=IR, we can get 
to the relation of resistance with resistivity.
\begin{equation}
R = \rho\frac{l}{wt} = R_s\frac{l}{w}
\cite{ref:3}
\label{eqn:6}
\end{equation}
Where, $R_s = \rho/t$. $R_s$ is the sheet resistance of the sample and it is 
only dependent on the thickness of the sample as per the equation. Notice that 
if the sample is perfectly square, l=w, $R_s = R$ \cite{ref:3}. By performing a 
two contact resistivity measurement we can receive values for the resistivity 
of the sample. However, as it will be more apparent later these values that we 
get do have a certain amount of error and a more accurate method can be 
employed. This method is the va der Pauw method which was developed in 1958 by 
Leo J. van der Pauw.
\\
To use this method the following conditions must be met \cite{ref:4}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item The contacts are at the circumference of the sample.
\item The contacts are sufficiently small.
\item The sample is homogeneous in thickness.
\item The surface of the sample is singly connected,i.e.,the sample does not 
have isolated holes.
\end{enumerate}
Now, the first condition assumes that the sample is a disc, but this method can 
work for any shape like a square. The derivation of the method can be found in 
\cite{ref:3}
Now, the first condition assumes that the sample is a disc, but this method can 
work for any shape like a square. The derivation of the method can be found in 
\cite{ref:3}. In figure \ref{fig:2}b we see that the contacts are placed in the 
corners. They do not have to necessarily be on the corners. They can be 
anywhere along the edge of the sample. According to van der Pauw's paper the 
resistivity of a sample using the four contact method can be calculated with 
the following equation.
\begin{equation}
\rho = \frac{\pi d}{\ln{2}}\frac{R_{AB,CD}+R_{BC,DA}}{2}f\left(\frac{R_{AB,CD}}{R_{BC,DA}}\right)
\cite{ref:4}
\label{eqn:7}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=3.5in]{f-function.png}
\caption{Plot of the f function from equation \ref{eqn:6} \cite{ref:3}.}
\label{fig:3}
\end{figure*}
Where, d is the thickness of the sample (t in the case of fig. \ref{fig:2}b), 
$R_{AB,CD}$ and $R_{BC,AD}$ represent current passing through the point and 
making the voltage measurement respectively. That is to say they are along the 
perpendicular current directions as can be inferred from figure \ref{fig:2}b. 
The function f is a function that behaves in 
similar fashion to that which is shown on figure \ref{fig:3}. Where it only 
satisfies the relation.
\begin{equation}
\frac{R_{AB,CD}-R_{BC,DA}}{R_{AB,CD}+R_{BC,DA}} = f\arccosh{\frac{\exp{\ln{2/f}}}{2}}
\cite{ref:4}
\label{eqn:8}
\end{equation}
Which can only be solved numerically to solve for f. Van der Pauw does provide 
another equation to approximate f where the ratio of $R_{AB,CD}/R_{BC,DA}$ are 
almost equal.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
f \approx 1-\left(\frac{R_{AB,CD}-R_{BC,DA}}{R_{AB,CD}+R_{BC,DA}}\right)^2\frac{\ln{2}}{2}- \\
\left(\frac{R_{AB,CD}-R_{BC,DA}}{R_{AB,CD}+R_{BC,DA}}\right)^4\left\{\frac{(ln{2})^2}{4}-\frac{(\ln{2})^2}{12}\right\}
\cite{ref:4}
\label{eqn:9}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
There is another method that can be used in which we use a table which is 
provided to us. However, to reduce errors from approximating to the second 
decimal point the f value is calculated for every ratio and was compared to the 
given f values. They agreed to the second decimal and was believed to be a 
better approximation than those given in the table.
\\
In general, we can represent the resistivity and conductivity of a sample of 
comparable size as a tensor meaning that the electric field and the current 
density may not necessarily be parallel to one another. Such matrices are the 
following.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{align*}
\rho &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\rho_{xx}&\rho_{xy} \\
-\rho_{xy}&\rho_{yy}
\end{bmatrix}
\\
\sigma &= 
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{xx}&\sigma_{xy} \\
-\sigma_{xy}&\sigma_{yy}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
\end{equation*}
Where, the x and y subscripts represent the sheet coordinate directions of the 
sample ignoring the z.
\\
Back in equation \ref{eqn:3} we showed the relation between the current density 
and the magnetic field to find the electric field that is produced by the Hall 
Effect. Here, a different form of it will be shown using vectors and tensors.
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}
E_{x}\\E_{y}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\rho_{xx}&\rho_{xy} \\ 
-\rho_{xy}&\rho_{yy}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
j_x \\ 0
\end{bmatrix}
\cite{ref:3}
\label{eqn:10}
\end{equation}
Where, $j_y = 0$ since there is no input current along the y direction of the 
sample only along the x direction. When equation \ref{eqn:10} is solved for the 
electric field components we can get the following equations.
\begin{equation}
\begin{align*}
E_x &= \rho_{xx}j_x\\
E_y &= -\rho_{xy}j_x
\cite{ref:3}
\label{eqn:11}
\end{align*}
\end{equation}
Where, if we transform equation \ref{eqn:11} as we did with equation 
\ref{eqn:4} we get a 
relation between $V_Hall$ and the xy resistance of the sample. Keep in mind 
that it is the Hall voltage as the field in the y direction is a direct cause 
of the magnetic filed that is along the z direction.
\begin{equation}
V_{Hall} = R_{xy}I
\cite{ref:3}
\label{eqn:12}
\end{equation}
Where, $R_{xy}$ is given by the equation.
\begin{equation}
R_{xy} = \frac{R_H}{t}B
\cite{ref:3}
\label{eqn:12}
\end{equation}
Where, $R_H$ is the Hall constant which depends on the carrier density and the 
charge of the carriers as shown.
\begin{equation}
R_{H} = \frac{1}{nq}
\cite{ref:3}
\label{eqn:13}
\end{equation}
Where, n is the number of carriers per unit volume and q is the charge of such 
carriers. Since, n is a integer value the sign of the Hall constant solely 
depends on the charge of the carriers. So, if the Hall constant is negative the 
charge carriers of the sample will be electrons and in the case of a positive 
value it will be holes (positive charge areas). In semiconductors this helps to 
identify what type of doping is used. If the semiconductor is n-type there is 
an excess of electrons where if it is p-type there is an excess of positively 
charged holes. Must be careful to not say protons as they do not flow when 
conducting electricity.
\\
By combining equations \ref{eqn:12} and \ref{eqn:12} we can make the following 
relationship between the Hall constant and the magnetic field.
\begin{equation}
R_{H} = \frac{V_{Hall}}{B}\frac{t}{I}
\cite{ref:3}
\label{eqn:14}
\end{equation}
Where, we can also re-write the equation to make the relationship between the 
magnetic field and the carrier density in a sample.
\begin{equation}
n = \frac{B}{V_{Hall}}\frac{I}{qt}
\label{eqn:15}
\end{equation}

Carrier mobility is defined as the ability of a charge carrier to pass through 
a sample material. The carrier mobility can be defined as the ratio between the 
drift velocity and the applied electric field. Which by transforming into the 
components of the electric field we can represent the carrier mobility as a 
function of the carrier density or the Hall constant.
\begin{equation}
\begin{align*}
\mu &= \frac{1}{\rho nq} \\
    &= \frac{R_H}{\rho} \\
    &= \frac{V_{Hall}}{B}\frac{t}{\rho q}
\cite{ref:3}
\label{eqn:16}

\section{Experimental Set-Up}
\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{temperature-cont.png}
\caption{Front panel of the temperature controller with the labeled components
\cite{ref:3}.}
\label{fig:6}
\end{figure*}
For this experiment a combination of equipment was used to make the 
measurements including a cryostat which housed the sample probe containing the 
sample, a temperature controller, a lock-in amplifier, a DC source, a vacuum 
pump and an electromagnet.
\subsection{Cryostat}
Since, it is necessary to make low temperature measurements in this experiment 
a three chamber cryostat is to be used. Where, the chambers are labeled on 
figure \ref{fig:4}. The inner and outer chambers must be at a near vacuum 
which can be 
achieved with the provided vacuum pump. \textbf{NEVER add liquid nitrogen until 
the air in the cryostat is evacuated}. Not doing so could result in the air 
moisture condensing inside the cryostat when the liquid nitrogen is added. The 
inner chamber should be vacummed twice once to remove most of the air in the 
chamber and a second time by putting Helium gas in the chamber and proceeding 
to them vacuum the Helium gas out of the chamber. This ensures that most if 
not all of the air has been taken out of the chamber and only very dilute He 
gas is left in the chamber. The outer chamber should be vacuumed for 5 minutes 
as it is a much larger volume than the inner chamber. Should the air in the 
cryostat freeze the sample or the entire cryostat could be damaged \cite{ref:3}.
\\
Once this is done the liquid nitrogen can be added into the cryostat by use of 
the funnel. The cryostat has a max capacity of approximately 5 liters of 
liquid. Be careful when puring the liquid nitrogen as it will sputter when it 
comes into contact with the funnel. \textbf{Always wear the safety equipment 
provided including: cryo-gloves, goggles and the lab coat} \cite{ref:3}.
\subsection{Sample probe}
The sample to be tested is mounted on a sample probe that will be placed in the 
cryostat by the instructor and won't need to be taken out. If there is ever a 
problem and it does need to be taken out of the cryostat the entire cryostat 
must reach room temperature before doing anything as breaking the seal in the 
inner chamber could damage the cryostat. The sample holder is shown on figure 
\ref{fig:5}
\\
The sample holder is actually a small box that is found at the end of the 
entire tube apparatus. On the sample holder the following components can be 
found \cite{ref:3}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item The suspension tube, which slides in the cap to vary the height of the 
specimen.
\item A copper vessel around the specimen and heater, which helps to keep the 
temperature unifor and reduces thermal fluctuations.
\item A temperature sensitive diode (DT471) that is used to measure the 
specimen temperature.
\item A heater which balances the cooling by the cold exchange gas (helium) 
that will surround the can and specimen, and helps control the rate of change 
in temperature of the specimen.
\item Sample holder which provides a flat mounting surface for the sample and 
the temperature sensitive diode.
\end{enumerate}
The sample that is to be tested is a doped silicon wafer with a thickness of 
300$\mu m$. It is mounted on the sample holder with the temperature sensitive 
diode located behind the sample. Since, there is a relation between resistance 
and temperature the temperature is found by the measured voltage across the 
diode which is given a current in the $\mu A$ range \cite{ref:3}.
\subsection{Temperature Controller}
To control the temperature a Lakeshore 330 Autotuning temperature controller is 
used. There are three LCD screens on the controller the top screen displays the 
measured temperature of the diode, the bottom gives the temperature that is 
set for the controller to maintain and the vertical screen gives the amount of 
current that is passing through the diode as a percentage. The amount of 
current passing through the sample is set by the heater value which can be: 
Low, Medium or High. The amount of current that is passed through the diode at 
each setting is given by the following table.
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\label{tbl:1}
\Centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Heater & Heater \\ Range & Current \\ \hline
HIGH & 0 to 1 A  \\ \hline
MEDIUM & 0 to 0.3 A \\ \hline
LOW & 0 to 0.1 A \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Heater current values at different set values \cite{ref:5}}
\end{minipage}
The temperature controller utilizes a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) 
feedback control loop to approach and maintain the temperature. The P, I, D 
parameters can be found on the main face of the Temperature Controller on 
figure \ref{fig:6}. But, it is only necessary to leave them in the default 
values of 50, 25, 0 for the P, I, D respectively.
\\
The heater setting can be changed by pressing the Heater button and cycling 
through the three differnt settings. The temperature change rate should not be 
set higher than 10 K/min in order to preserve the temperature equilibrium in 
the sample space. This can be checked and changed by holding the set point 
button until the screen changes to the rate. Using the keypad the rate can be 
set to whatever value is necessary.
\subsection{Lock-in amplifier}
\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{lock-in.png}
\caption{Front panel of the lock-in amplifier with the labeled components
\cite{ref:3}.}
\label{fig:7}
\end{figure*}
A Stanford Research Systems Model SR810 Lock-in amplifier is used in making the 
AC measurements in this experiment. The general layout of the front panel is 
shown on figure \ref{fig:7}. A lock-in amplifier is very useful in experiments 
that involve a lot of noisy data as it can reduce the noise from the data 
significantly and give a very clean signal. It can do so by multypling the 
input signal by the frequency of the reference signal and integrating it with 
respect to some time frame. The resulting DC signal has a frequency that is the 
same as that of the reference signal. The lock-in amplifier is very sensitive 
to different phases due to the orthogonality of sine and cosine functions 
\cite{ref:3}.
\\
For this experiment there will be a $V_{rms}$ output of 1.000 V that will pass 
through a 1 $M\Omega$ resistor to make a 1 $\mu A$ current signal. This signal 
will come from the Sine Output to a box with the resistor with two outputs that 
will connect to the wiring interface. The signal is received by the Signal 
Inputs. This will be an AC signal that will be transformed into a DC signal 
by the lock-in amplifier by the process described above. The following should 
be set to take measurements as well:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item Couple to AC
\item Ground to Float
\item Time Constant to 1 s (1x1 s) and 12 dB
\item Display to R
\end{enumerate}
The sensitivity should be set to a value larger than that which you are trying 
to measure. It is recommended to use a sensitivity of 10 mV. Remember to hit 
the Phase button under AUTO on the right of the panel.
\subsection{DC source}
\begin{figure*}
\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=3.5in]{DC-sourc.png}
\caption{Front panel of the DC \cite{ref:3}.}
\label{fig:8}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure*}
The DC source that is to be used is a Keithley 227 DC source. To perform the DC 
Hall Voltage measurements it will need to be set to output a 1 mA current. The 
knobs on the top of the device set the output current. Be mindful of where the 
light is as it is the decimal point. To produce a 1 mA current set the 
following to the said values \cite{ref:3}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*]
\item Set the units digit to 1 and all others to zero
\item Set the rightmost knob to mA with 300 MAX COMP VOLT
\end{enumerate}
Be sure to measure if the output is exactly 1 mA with a multi-meter. The first 
decimal knob may need to be played around with to get it as close to one as you 
can as it tends to be a bit loose and hard to set to exactly zero.
\subsection{Vacuum pumping system}
A single mechanical pump is used to vacuum both sections of the cryostat. 
Valves are provided on the respective spaces to give a good seal. When the pump 
is to be removed from the vacumming valves, make sure to close the valves to 
ensure that a vacuum is maintained at all times. If the pump is shut off 
before the valves are closed some air may be able to leak back into the 
vacuum spaces \cite{ref:3}.
\subsection{Electromagnet}
A water cooled electromagnet is used to produce the static magnetic field to 
make the Hall Effect measurements. There is a power supply unit that can be 
used to provide the current to the electromagnet. \textbf{Do not exceed 35 A 
on the power supply as it can overheat the magnet and permanently damage it}. 
To be able to measure two different magnetic field directions a bar is provided 
at the top of the sample probe. Refer to the markings on this bar to see the 
direction of the magnetic field with respect to the plane of the sample. 
\textbf{Make sure that the bar is well aligned with the magnetic plates prior 
to making measurements as we assume that the magnetic field is perfectly 
perpendicular to the sample. Tiny deviations from this could result in 
significant differences as the cross product in equation \ref{eqn:2} may not 
be perfect}. The table below shows the field strength in Tesla as a function 
of the electromagnet current.

\section{Results and Discussion}
All of the longitudal directions are labeled with the same lettering as that in 
figure \ref{fig:2}b.
\subsection{DC 2-contact resistance}
In this part of the experiment we measured the resistance of the sample using 
an ohm-meter for the four possible longitudal directions.
\\
The data that is gotten is shown below.
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\Centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Direction & Resistance ($k\Omega$) \\ \hline
AB & 4.77 \\ \hline
BC & 2.57 \\ \hline
CD & 6.62 \\ \hline
EF & 7.02 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\captionof{table}{Data for part (i)}
\label{tbl:3}
\end{minipage}
From this data it is not possible to calculate the resistivity as we have a 
the resistance of the sample through those points and according to equation 
\ref{eqn:6} we need to know the other dimensions of the sample, for which, we 
did not.
\subsection{DC 4-contact resistance}
In this portion of the experiment we measured the voltage from passing current 
through two adjacent points and measuring the voltage through the other two. 
The data for it is shown on the table below where the direction of the current 
flow is important as it is we are the DC source. The current value was set to 
be 0.99 mA.
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Direction & Absolute \\ From $\to\,$ to & Voltage (mV) \\ \hline
A $\to\,$ B & 1.169 \\ \hline
B $\to\,$ A & 1.179 \\ \hline
B $\to\,$ C & 0.3037 \\ \hline
C $\to\,$ B & 0.2955 \\ \hline
C $\to\,$ D & 1.069 \\ \hline
D $\to\,$ C & 0.839 \\ \hline
D $\to\,$ A & 0.3003 \\ \hline
A $\to\,$ D & 0.2821 \\ \hline

From these values the van der Pauw method can be applied to calculate the 
resistivity of the sample. Since the value of the measured voltage is expected 
to be the same in both directions (ie. from A to B and B to A), the average of 
the two values was taken and used in the calculations. The van der Pauw 
resistivity was calculated using equations \ref{eqn:7} and \ref{eqn:9} using 
C++. The results are shown in the following table where the current direction 
is no longer important.
\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Direction & Resistivity ($\Omega m$) \\ \hline
AB & 0.877 $\pm$ 0.004 \\ \hline
BC & 0.774 $\pm$ 0.004 \\ \hline
CD & 0.764 $\pm$ 0.004 \\ \hline
DA & 0.867 $\pm$ 0.004 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Pauw method for the DC 4-contact resistance.}

\end{minipage}
For the error analysis a constant error of 0.010 mV was assumed for all of the 
measurements and the error in the f value was ignored.

For this part of the experiment the carrier type was determing by analyzing the 
slope of the line of data that was taken at different magnetic field values 
taken at room temperature. A current value of 1.00 mA was passed through the 
sample. The data is shown below.
