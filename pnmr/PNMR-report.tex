Nuclear Magnetic resonance has been a tool that has been used by scientists for
many years to analyze solids and liquids to identify structure and intrinsic 
properties of such materials. In this experiment, the Spin-Lattice relaxation 
time and Spin-Spin Relaxation time for mineral oil, copper sulfate solutions 
and Isoproponyl-2 were measured. The Spin-Lattice relaxation times of mineral 
oil and Isoproponyl-2 solution were measured to be: 37.7 $\pm$ 0.9 ms, 570 
$\pm$ 30 ms respectively. The Spin-Lattice relaxation times of the CuSO
\textsubscript{4} are as follows: 0.005M solution 99 $\pm$ 8 ms, 0.010M 
solution 61 $\pm$ 2 ms, 0.050M solution 13.6 $\pm$ 0.2 ms, 0.100M solution
6.5 $\pm$ 0.1 ms, 0.200M solution 3.26 $\pm$ 0.06 ms, 0.500M solution 1.25 
$\pm$ 0.03 ms, 1.000M solution 0.69 $\pm$ 0.01 ms. For the Spin-Spin relaxation 
times of mineral oil the results are as follows: 58.2 $\pm$ 0.4 ms with 
individual measurements, 27.1 $\pm$ 0.9 ms with Carr-Purcell method and 54.8 
$\pm$ 0.4 with the Meiboom-Gill method. For Isoproponyl-2 the Spin-Spin 
relaxation time was measured to be 174 $\pm$ 3 ms with the Meiboom-Gill method. 
For the CuSO\textsubscript{4} solutions the Meiboom-Gill method was employed 
and the Spin-Spin relaxation times are as follows: 0.005M solution 98 $\pm$ 3 
ms, 0.010M solution 79 $\pm$ 1 ms, 0.050M solution 17.3 $\pm$ 0.6 ms, 0.100M 
solution 9.6 $\pm$ 0.3 ms, 0.200M solution 4.5 $\pm$ 0.1 ms, 0.500M solution 
1.74 $\pm$ 0.05 ms and 1.000M solution 0.93 $\pm$ 0.02 ms.

\section{Introduction}
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a spectroscopic method that was developed 
by Edward Purcell and Felix Bloch independently with different instrumentation 
in the late 1940's. This new spectroscopic technique made use of the nuclear 
magnetic moments of atoms to be able to tell structure among other intrinsic 
properties of solids and liquids. This discovery marked a landmark in the 
study of materials by many different disciplines in scince including: physics, 
chemistry and biology. 
\\
Originally the method was developed with taking measurements of the Free 
Induction Decay (FID) signal. This was a signal that could be measured when 
a population of spins aligned in a magnetic filed given by a permanent 
magnetic field (B\textsubscript{0}) were disturbed from that position along 
the z-axis by a Continuous Wave (CW) Radio Frequency (RF) magnetic field 
(B\textsubscript{1}) along the xy-plane of the sample spins. The decay of the 
spins back to their equilibrium position along the z-axis became known as the 
FID signal. By analyzing this signal different properties of the material 
being tested would be found such as the Spin-Spin and the Spin-Lattice 
relaxation times.
\\
However, in 1950 Edward L. Hahn had discovered that after the sample spins were excited by the B\textsubscript{1} pulse there would be a secondary pulse on the
FID signal at resonance. It was noticed that this secondary would not be in 
response to the previous pulse which was a strong RF pulse lasting for a given 
amount of time. This would be known as the Hahn Spin Echo. This method has 
become widely used and is the basis for the measurements in this experiment.
\\
NMR has also made its way into medicine in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) 
where it has offered a better alternative of imaging tissues by utilizing ions 
and other substances that can be imaged with NMR. It has become a better 
alternative since there is no longer the requirement of a radioactive sample 
being injected into the patient like in CAT scans where the patient is exposed 
to X-Rays. The only downside is that there can be no magnetic materials present 
or it can damage the high magnetic field magnet or the patient.
\section{Theory}
NMR experiments can actually work because much like electrons, nucleons 
(protons, neutrons) have spin $\pm1/2$ and arrange themselves in 
a configuration called the Nuclear Shell model which is depicted in a very 
similar fashion to that of the Atomic Shell model which describes the 
arrangement 
of electrons in the electronic orbitals. This is to say that they too fill up 
their 
respective shell positions according to the Pauli Exclusion principle. By 
having a very strong permanent magnetic field B\textsubscript{0} the nuclear 
spins could be alinged in the direction of the magnetic field (z-axis). With 
magnetic energy given by,
\begin{equation} %1
U = -\vec{\mu}\cdot\vec{B}
\label{eqn:1}
\cite{ref:2}
\end{equation}
Where, $\vec{\mu}$ is defined by,
\begin{equation} %2
\vec{\mu} = \gamma\hbar\vec{I}
\label{eqn:2}
\cite{ref:2}
\end{equation}
Where, $\vec{J} = \hbar\vec{I}$ is the angular momentum and $\vec{\mu}$ is the 
magnetic moment of the particle. With $\gamma$ being the gyromagnetic ratio, 
$\vec{I}$ is the spin of the particle which is $\pm1/2$ in our case. Therefore, 
the energy difference between the two energy levels becomes,
\begin{equation} %3
\Delta U = \hbar\omega_0 = \gamma\hbar B_0
\label{eqn:3}
\cite{ref:2}
\end{equation}
Where, $B_0$ is the permanent magnetic field aligned with the z-axis and 
$\omega_0 = \gamma B_0$ which gives the resonance value for a proton. In which 
the gyromagnetic ratio is equal to $2.675 \cdot 10^4 rad/s\cdot gauss$
\cite{ref:2}.
\\
According to equation 3, the difference in the energy of the two spins is 
highly controlled by the permanent magnetic field that is used. Therefore, the 
energy difference between the two spins is very small and there is an almost 
equal probability of the spins being in one direction or the opposite when in 
the magnetic field. The Boltzman Distribution gives us the ratio of the spin 
populations as such,
\begin{equation} %4
\frac{N_1}{N_2} = e^{\frac{-\Delta U}{kT}} = e^{\frac{-h\omega_0}{kT}}
\label{eqn:4}
\cite{ref:2}
\end{equation}
Where, there will be a net spin population of approximately 1 in 10,000 in any 
of the directions. This is one reason for which NMR requires high number of 
nuclei present in the sample\cite{ref:1}.
However, it's almost as likely that they will line up against the B
\textsubscript{0} since the difference between the spin 1/2 and spin -1/2 are 
only a few milicalories apart. For this fact there is a thermal equilibrium of 
the two spin populations which follows the Boltzman distribution law. Which 
tells us that the population difference between these two states is less than 
1 nucelus in 10,000. According to this, a very large sample will be needed in 
order to be able to make good measurements with NMR\cite{ref:1}.
\\
The fundamental principle behind NMR centers on the induction of the transition 
between the different Zeeman splitting levels of a nucelus. These splitting 
levels are important since they are the excited spin states of the nucleons and 
as they relax back to their ground state configuration they will create the 
FID signal. To be able to transition between the different spin states an 
additional field to B\textsubscript{0} must be applied. This field unlike the 
B\textsubscript{0} field must be a variable radio frequency (RF) field known as 
the B\textsubscript{1} field and it must have a frequency equal to the resonant 
frequency of the nucleons in the sample. It should also be noted that the 
transitions obey the transition rules of the angular momenta, that is to say, 
the difference in the angular momenta between the transitions cannot exceed 1
\cite{ref:2}.

field\cite{ref:2}.}
\label{fig:1}
\justify
Figure 1 gives a representation of the energy splitting in the different spin 
levels in a nucleus with spin $\pm$1/2. However, there can exist a different 
number of spin states in different atoms depending on their total spin like in 
atoms with a total spin of 3/2. In figure 1 the energy splitting level is equal 
to the enrgy representation in equation \ref{eqn:3}.
\\
The magnetization of the nuclei in the sample can be given by the following 
equation,
\begin{equation}
M_z = (N_1-N_2)\mu
\label{eqn:5}
\cite{ref:2}
\end{equation}
Which is to say that this equation stems directly from the initial hypothesis 
that there is a correlation between the net spin populations in the sample and 
the magnetization of the sample. So then the expression to give the thermal 
equilibrium magnetization of the sample can be given by,
\begin{equation}
M_0 = N\mu \tanh(\frac{\mu B}{kT})\approx N \frac{\mu^2 B}{kT}
\label{eqn:6}
\cite{ref:2}
\end{equation}
Where, N is the difference between the spin states. It should be noted that 
this thermal equilibrium magnetization is not instantaneous. Though, nothing is 
instantaneous; nothing can be faster than the speed of light. This property is 
time dependent and it grows in an exponential fashion as represented of Figure 
\ref{fig:2}. The differential equation that describes the process of rate of 
aproach to thermal equilibrium is give by equation \ref{eqn:7}.
\begin{equation}
\frac{dM_z}{dt} = \frac{M_0 - M_z}{T_1}
\label{eqn:7}
\cite{ref:2}
\end{equation}
In which, T\textsubscript{1} is the Spin-Lattice relaxation time. This property 
is a property which is different between samples and describes the lifetime of 
a nucleonic spin in an excited state before relaxing back to its thermal 
equilibrium position. By which, may be 
one extremely important factor in an experiment since were it not for the spins 
re-establishing thermal equilibrium the experiment would not be able to 
continue. The Spin-Lattice environment is defined by the Spin reffering to the 
individual nucleonic spin that is being measured and the Lattice which includes 
the entire surroundings of the nuceleons. By integrating equation \ref{eqn:7} 
we get to equation \ref{eqn:8} which relates the exponential decaying of the 
measurable magnetization, which can only occur in the xy-plane, to the 
Spin-Lattice relaxation time \cite{ref:1}.
\begin{equation}
M_z (t) = M_0 (1-e^{-t/T_1})
\label{eqn:8}
\cite{ref:2}
\end{equation}
As it has been stated the T\textsubscript{1} time depends on the material being 
tested and can have a very wide range which can range from milliseconds to 
seconds \cite{ref:2}. Since this property gives the amount of time that will 
take for the 
system to re-establish equilibrium. One must give this much time in between 
repetitions of measurements to be able to take correct measurements or else the 
spins may be in an excited state and never give useful data.
\\
Now, one should keep in mind that this is the very basic concepts behind the 
Spin-Lattice phenomena. The other forms of Relaxation Phenomena related to 
Spin-Lattice relaxation may come into play when delaing with organic molecules 
and multi-species samples. Some of them are: Dipole-Dipole Relaxation, 
Spin-Rotation Relaxation, Chemical Shift Anisotropy and Scalar relaxation. 
These are believed to be outside the scope of this report so they will not be 
explained \cite{ref:1}.

the spins after exriencing a 180\textsuperscript{o} pulse. The intersection 
with the x-axis gives the Spin-Lattice relaxation time. Lower trace: measured 
representation of the spins during the experiment. Note the initial decay as 
compared to the upper trace.}
\label{fig:2}
\justify
As is mentioned in the caption on Figure \ref{fig:2} one method to get the 
T\textsubscript{1} relaxation time is by finding the intersection on the 
x-axis. Now here comes the problem, by inspection of equation \ref{eqn:8} there 
will be a problem when trying to solve the equation for 0 analytically. The 
steps one can take are the following.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}[c] 
M_z (t) &= M_0 (1-e^{-t/T_1}) \\
0 &= M_0 (1-e^{-t/T_1}) \\
1 &= e^{-t/T_1} \\
\ln{1} &= \frac{-t}{T_1} \\
0 &= \frac{-t}{T_1}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
In which, the very last line presented makes no mathematical sense since t/
T\textsubscript{1} will not be zero unless t = 0. To combat this an error term, 
$\epsilon$, is added by splitting equation \ref{eqn:8} to look like,
\begin{equation}
M_z (t) = (M_0 + \epsilon) \cdot (-M_0 e^{-t/T_1})\
\label{eqn:9}
\end{equation}
Where the first term will be represented as one whole number in the discussion 
section. However, there is another method that can also be used. By simple 
inspection of equation \ref{eqn:8}, once again, one can see that the value of 
interest is contained in the exponential term, for which one could in fact, 
make use of the fact that the data will have an exponential fit and use the 
exponential term to calculate the T\textsubscript{1} relaxation time. The 
accuracy of these two will be compared and discussed further in the Discussion 
section.
\\
There exists a second form of relaxation different to that previously 
introduced, Spin-Spin Relaxation time (T\textsubscript{2}). While the 
T\textsubscript{1} process describes the transfer of energy from a spin into 
the environment, the T\textsubscript{2} process describes the loss of phase of 
a system over time \cite{ref:3}. This dephasing is usually due to 
neighboring spins that interact with each other and since they themselves have 
a magnetic moment they will make an inhomogenous magnetic field on a 
microspcopic scale. Due to these inhomogenieties in the magnetic field the 
individual magnetic moments will precess at different frequencies \cite{ref:1}.
\\
This type of relaxation is only present when the proper B\textsubscript{1} 
field is applied on the sample inducing a rotation of the magnetic momenta. 
Which then leads to the precession of the spins about the B\textsubscript{0} 
field. This secondary magnetic field B\textsubscript{1} is actually a 
circularly polraized magnetic field which can be represented by the equation,
\begin{equation}
\vec{B} = B_1\cos(\omega t)\hat{i} + B_1\sin(\omega t)\hat{j} + B_0 \hat{k}
\label{eqn:10}
